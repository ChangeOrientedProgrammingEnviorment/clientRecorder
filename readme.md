COPE ClientRecorder
===================

The ClientRecorder plugin for Eclipse records source code changes
and unit test runs. Data collected by the ClientRecorder will
allow us to understand how developers change complex code and
use Test-Driven Development practices to structure source code
edits.

This plugin will record source code changes in your IDE and send
the collected data to OSU. If you have any problems with the
plugin (exceptions, errors, etc) or have any suggestions please
send an email to cope@eecs.oregonstate.edu.
