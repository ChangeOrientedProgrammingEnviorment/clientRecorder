aboutText=The ClientRecorder plugin for Eclipse records source code changes and unit test runs. Data collected by the ClientRecorder will allow us to understand how developers change complex code and use Test-Driven Development practices to structure source code edits.\n\
\nThis plugin will record source code changes in your IDE and send the collected data to OSU. If you have any problems with the plugin (exceptions, errors, etc) or have any suggestions please send an email to cope@eecs.oregonstate.edu.
